            homemade lasagna recipes with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filing. <br>
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipes calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. <br>
            Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
